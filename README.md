# tie-command
Software developed for the ability to record bash commands and store them in a file. 
Useful for when doing a complicated task that you don't want to have to do later (server setup, etc.).

Right now the best way to set it up is to put 'alias tiec="/full/path/to/dir/tiec.sh"' in your .bashrc
